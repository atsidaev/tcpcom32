fBinary 
If this member is TRUE, binary mode is enabled. Windows does not support nonbinary mode transfers, so this member must be TRUE.

fParity 
If this member is TRUE, parity checking is performed and errors are reported.

fOutxCtsFlow 
If this member is TRUE, the CTS (clear-to-send) signal is monitored for output flow control. If this member is TRUE and CTS is turned off, output is suspended until CTS is sent again.

fOutxDsrFlow 
If this member is TRUE, the DSR (data-set-ready) signal is monitored for output flow control. If this member is TRUE and DSR is turned off, output is suspended until DSR is sent again.

fDtrControl 
The DTR (data-terminal-ready) flow control. This member can be one of the following values.

	Value Meaning 
	DTR_CONTROL_DISABLE
	0x00
	 Disables the DTR line when the device is opened and leaves it disabled.
	 
	DTR_CONTROL_ENABLE
	0x01
	 Enables the DTR line when the device is opened and leaves it on.
	 
	DTR_CONTROL_HANDSHAKE
	0x02
	 Enables DTR handshaking. If handshaking is enabled, it is an error for the application to adjust the line by using the EscapeCommFunction function.
 

fDsrSensitivity 
If this member is TRUE, the communications driver is sensitive to the state of the DSR signal. The driver ignores any bytes received, unless the DSR modem input line is high.

fTXContinueOnXoff 
If this member is TRUE, transmission continues after the input buffer has come within XoffLim bytes of being full and the driver has transmitted the XoffChar character to stop receiving bytes. If this member is FALSE, transmission does not continue until the input buffer is within XonLim bytes of being empty and the driver has transmitted the XonChar character to resume reception.

fOutX 
Indicates whether XON/XOFF flow control is used during transmission. If this member is TRUE, transmission stops when the XoffChar character is received and starts again when the XonChar character is received.

fInX 
Indicates whether XON/XOFF flow control is used during reception. If this member is TRUE, the XoffChar character is sent when the input buffer comes within XoffLim bytes of being full, and the XonChar character is sent when the input buffer comes within XonLim bytes of being empty.

fErrorChar 
Indicates whether bytes received with parity errors are replaced with the character specified by the ErrorChar member. If this member is TRUE and the fParity member is TRUE, replacement occurs.

fNull 
If this member is TRUE, null bytes are discarded when received.

fRtsControl 
The RTS (request-to-send) flow control. This member can be one of the following values.

	Value Meaning 
	RTS_CONTROL_DISABLE
	0x00
	 Disables the RTS line when the device is opened and leaves it disabled.
	 
	RTS_CONTROL_ENABLE
	0x01
	 Enables the RTS line when the device is opened and leaves it on.
	 
	RTS_CONTROL_HANDSHAKE
	0x02
	 Enables RTS handshaking. The driver raises the RTS line when the "type-ahead" (input) buffer is less than one-half full and lowers the RTS line when the buffer is more than three-quarters full. If handshaking is enabled, it is an error for the application to adjust the line by using the EscapeCommFunction function.
	 
	RTS_CONTROL_TOGGLE
	0x03
	 Specifies that the RTS line will be high if bytes are available for transmission. After all buffered bytes have been sent, the RTS line will be low.
 

fAbortOnError 
If this member is TRUE, the driver terminates all read and write operations with an error status if an error occurs. The driver will not accept any further communications operations until the application has acknowledged the error by calling the ClearCommError function.

XonLim 
The minimum number of bytes allowed in the input buffer before flow control is activated to inhibit the sender. Note that the sender may transmit characters after the flow control signal has been activated, so this value should never be zero. This assumes that either XON/XOFF, RTS, or DTR input flow control is specified in fInX, fRtsControl, or fDtrControl.

XoffLim 
The maximum number of bytes allowed in the input buffer before flow control is activated to allow transmission by the sender. This assumes that either XON/XOFF, RTS, or DTR input flow control is specified in fInX, fRtsControl, or fDtrControl. The maximum number of bytes allowed is calculated by subtracting this value from the size, in bytes, of the input buffer.

ByteSize 
The number of bits in the bytes transmitted and received.

Parity 
The parity scheme to be used. This member can be one of the following values.

	Value Meaning 
	EVENPARITY
	2
	 Even parity.
	 
	MARKPARITY
	3
	 Mark parity.
	 
	NOPARITY
	0
	 No parity.
	 
	ODDPARITY
	1
	 Odd parity.
	 
	SPACEPARITY
	4
	 Space parity.
	 

StopBits 
The number of stop bits to be used. This member can be one of the following values.

	Value Meaning 
	ONESTOPBIT
	0
	 1 stop bit.
	 
	ONE5STOPBITS
	1
	 1.5 stop bits.
	 
	TWOSTOPBITS
	2
	 2 stop bits.
	 

XonChar 
The value of the XON character for both transmission and reception.

XoffChar 
The value of the XOFF character for both transmission and reception.

ErrorChar 
The value of the character used to replace bytes received with a parity error.

EofChar 
The value of the character used to signal the end of data.

EvtChar 
The value of the character used to signal an event.


Remarks
When a DCB structure is used to configure the 8250, the following restrictions apply to the values specified for the ByteSize and StopBits members:

	The number of data bits must be 5 to 8 bits. 
	The use of 5 data bits with 2 stop bits is an invalid combination, as is 6, 7, or 8 data bits with 1.5 stop bits.
